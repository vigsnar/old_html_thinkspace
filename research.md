My past and current research efforts are concerned with problems emerging in the context of networked dynamical systems and the data generated by them. I am particularly interested in tackling commonly encountered and critical tasks, e.g., analysis, learning, and control design, that arise in the context of large-scale dynamical systems and complex networks in emerging applications across engineering, physical, and biological domains. In my research, I strive to address such problems by developing theoretical and algorithmic frameworks that are reliable, tractable, and secure. In addition to developing systematic frameworks for solving challenging problems, I am also interested in developing mathematically grounded computational and learning tools that are efficient, interpretable, and scalable.
