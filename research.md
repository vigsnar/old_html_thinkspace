<!--Our interests lead to an interdisciplinary research program across boundaries of science and engineering.My past and current research efforts are concerned with problems emerging in the context of networked dynamical systems and the data generated by them. I am particularly interested in tackling commonly encountered and critical tasks, e.g., analysis, learning, and control design, that arise in the context of large-scale dynamical systems and complex networks in emerging applications across engineering, physical, and biological domains. Specific goals 1. Theory and algorithmic frameworks: reliable, tractable, and secure 2. Computational and learning tools: efficient, interpretable, and scalable-->

<!--<h2>Research Topics<h2>-->
<h3>Dynamical systems and Networks</h3>
<!--Engineered systems encountered in many scientific domains are increasingly complex, highly interconnected, and dynamic. Furthermore, in recent times, the processes and mechanisms previously confined to biology, social science, etc., are viewed through the prism of systems theory. As a consequence, many complex networked dynamical systems are emerging. The ability to decode the structural and dynamic information of such systems using observation (or measurement) data and the capability to precisely manipulate them are both essential steps toward enabling their safe and efficient deployment in safety-critical applications. -->

<h4>Modeling and data-integrated appoaches for dynamical systems</h4>
<!--Although model learning or system identification has been an active research topic in the past few decades, new challenges that have arisen in light of the emergence of the *internet of things* and *big data*. Primarily, many highly nonlinear and interconnected dynamical processes have emerged in diverse applications. Secondly, the objective in a system identification or model learning problem has evolved with an increased emphasis placed on specifications such as interpretability and reliability of the recovered models. For instance, the tasks of identifying key ionic channel contributors to neuronal dynamics and inferring the hub cells in the circadian network from their *in vitro* voltage recordings are not typical system identification problems. However, such problems find applications in clinical and experimental neuroscience. Furthermore, the learning strategies to accomplish this task are required to be tractable with quantifiable performance guarantees in terms of accuracy, data sufficiency, and safety.   To address these challenges for general nonlinear dynamical systems and networks, I recently developed a perturbation approach for learning interpretable models of dynamical systems and nonlinear dynamic networks. These perturbation approaches turned out to be extremely fruitful in that they informed on a tractable data generation protocol and a learning strategy for network and model inference. My long-term goals are: to integrate information-theoretic and -geometric tools to optimize the data-generation protocol and derive quantifiable bounds on the accuracy and data sufficiency metrics; and to investigate the problem of recovering the geometric quantities, e.g., Riemannian metric, and topological features, e.g., cell complex structure and Euler characteristic, of the state-space manifold of dynamical systems from their measurement data.-->

<h4>Analysis and control synthesis for dynamic populations</h4>
<!--In my doctoral research, I proposed learning-based (real-time) control design methodologies in the context of NDS. This included the development of data-driven, adaptive, and online control design frameworks to manipulate interconnected dynamical systems. In these works, I employed computational neural networks in the control loop to learn solutions to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation associated with the optimal control problems, where practical considerations in the context of computational and communication costs were addressed. The proposed learning strategies enabled real-time adaptive optimal control of NDS. On the other hand, in many emerging applications, the feedback information is characterized by data variety, e.g., images or videos, and irregularity, e.g., NDS operating at various spatio-temporal scales leading to disparate measurement data. It is essential to develop rigorous theory and learning methodologies for incorporating such diverse measurement data to enable efficient data-integrated analysis and control for NDS. In this context, more recently, I proposed moment-based methods to address learning and control tasks concerning with large populations of dynamical systems. This was mainly motivated by applications generating population-level feedback such as neural networks and quantum systems, which typically consists of time-series data characterized by temporal sparsity and variety, e.g., fragmented images or snapshots. I intend to expand my research in the direction of moment-based methods for ensemble systems, which finds applications in quantum control systems, neural networks, multi-agent systems, dynamic data analysis, and large-scale robotics. Moreover, leveraging my works on intelligent control systems and moment-based methods for ensembles, I will focus on the development of learning-based control strategies for autonomous populations of dynamical systems with performance guarantees.-->
 
<h3>Data science and Learning theory</h3>
<!--Typically, to solve mathematically ill-posed learning problems, abstract learning tools such as deep neural networks are commonly employed to reconstruct unknown functions using data. Despite their popularity, they suffer from tedious and heuristic design, and in general, lacks interpretability both in design and in functionality. To move towards tractable strategies of employing NNs in control applications, I proposed interpretable and tractable learning strategies for model learning and controlling spiking neurons and network of neurons, respectively. In this context, in a collaborative work, we recently developed interpretable design of reservoir computing networks using system-theoretic principles. Furthermore, in the age of big data, it is inevitable to perform learning tasks that involve large-volumes of data. To deal with voluminous data, computational tools are required to be scalable, adaptive, and efficient. Recently, in a collaborative work, we developed a computational tool for solving large-scale linear-inverse problems, the parallel residual projection, which adopted a divide-and-conquer approach to address scalability issues. Building on this work, I will work on developing scalable, mathematically-grounded computational algorithms to solve large-scale optimization problems, with an application focus on deep-neural networks.-->

<!--The proposed research in data-integrated systems theory has immediate applications in multidisciplinary areas. I am particularly interested in incorporating the developed theory in specific applications domains, and to this end, I have proposed data-integrated control design methodologies for robotic systems, e.g., robot manipulators, unmanned aerial vehicles, formation control of mobile robots, and 
spike sequence control in a network of neuron models. In line with my past and current research efforts, I will continue to focus on problems that are of great urgency and relevance in the application domains including robotics, neuroscience, and energy systems.
Furthermore, while several complex systems are engineered to enable automation and reduce human risk, the ability of many naturally occurring dynamical systems to perform complex tasks with energy efficiency, reliability, and robustness is still not fully understood. This introduces a compelling need to seek novel ways to identify and understand natural processes of interest, which can help improve and synthesize efficient engineering systems. Specifically, I am interested in using systems and learning approaches to uncover population coding mechanism in neural networks, where I will seek to expand and build on my work of reconstructing neural models. I am also interested in collaborating with fields experts in diverse areas including biology and medicine to bridge the gap between the developed theory and practical applications.--
