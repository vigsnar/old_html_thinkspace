    I am currently a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering at the Washington University in St. Louis (WashU). 
    <!--affiliated with the <a href="https://www.ese.wustl.edu/~jsli/AMLab/Home.html">Applied Mathematics Lab</a> (PI: Dr. Jr-Shin Li).
    Previously, I was with the <a href="https://braindynamics.engineering.wustl.edu">Brain Dynamics and Control Research Group</a> (PI: Dr. ShiNung Ching).-->
    Before joining WashU, I was a graduate student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering  at the Missouri University of Science and Technology.

    My current and past affiliations are:  
    1. <a href="https://www.ese.wustl.edu/~jsli/AMLab/Home.html">Applied Mathematics Lab @WashU</a>;
    2. <a href="https://braindynamics.engineering.wustl.edu">Brain Dynamics and Control Research Group @WashU</a>; and 
  3. <a href="https://web.mst.edu/~sarangap/">Embedded Control Systems and Networking Laboratory @MST</a>.
    </p>

    <p align="justify"> 
     My past and current projects revolve around problems that emerge in the context of dynamical systems and the data generated by them. 
     My current research interest and focus is on the areas of dynamical systems and networks, data science and learning theory, and computational neuroscience.
