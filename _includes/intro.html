    Welcome to my page!
    I am currently a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering at the Washington University in St. Louis (WashU). 
    Before joining WashU, I was a graduate student in the <a href="https://web.mst.edu/~sarangap/">Embedded Control Systems and Networking Laboratory</a>(PI: Dr. Jagannathan Sarangapani) at the Missouri University of Science and Technology. 
    In my postdocoral research, I was affiliated with <a href="https://braindynamics.engineering.wustl.edu">Brain Dynamics and Control Research Group</a>(PI: Dr. ShiNung Ching) and <a href="https://www.ese.wustl.edu/~jsli/AMLab/Home.html">Applied Mathematics Lab</a>(PI: Dr. Jr-Shin Li) at WashU. I am currently hosted by Dr. Jr-Shin Li at WashU.
