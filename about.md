I am currently a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering at the Washington University in St. Louis. I am currently hosted by Dr. Jr-Shin Li at WashU. Previously, I was working with Dr. ShiNung Ching and Dr. Jr-Shin Li at WashU. I joined WashU as a postdoctoral associate after completing my doctoral research in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Missouri University of Science and Technology under the supervision of Dr. Jagannathan Sarangapani.
